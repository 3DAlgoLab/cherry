A PyTorch reinforcement learning framework for researchers.

# TODO

Some functionalities that we might want to implement.

* normalize / serialize / parallelize environments,
* compute advantages / policy gradients / rewards,
* print and log training / debugging stats,
* distributed / async training,
* fix: what is up with the non-determinism ?
* sample batches from replay,
* function to sample experience,
* handle recurrent policies,
* functions for GAE, discounted and bootstrapped rewards,
* unified support for continuous and discrete environments,
* one high-performance implementation of A2C on Breakout and Ant-v1. (or pybullet equivalent)
